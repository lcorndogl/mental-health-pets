# Introduction
Mental Health has become an issue that has some stigma attached to it, however with people now talking about it and the impacts that it can have on daily living, this project aims to highlight some of the things that pets can help with when dealing with mental health issues.

## Colour Scheme
The colour scheme has been chosen with the familiar colours of the NHS in the UK in mind, this is instill a consistency with the user expectations of other health services

## Imagery
The imagery used in this project has been taken by myself and my experiences owning my own pet.

## Typography
The typography used has been selected from Google Fonts, searching using the 'calm' filter, as a little addage to people who may be suffering with mental health and looking for information, as to not be an agressive font which could cause further issues in extreme cases

# Technologies Used
## HTML
Basic HTML is used to create the information to be displayed in the pages, links and other general website functions
## CSS
CSS is used to allow the formatting of the website, making it responsive and intuitive for the user to use
## Git
Git has been used to create versioning for the site as it is developed.
## GitHub
GitHub has been used as the central respository where the code will be accessible online. It has also been used to deploy the website to allow for testing throughout the development process as well as a location for the project to be visible to all
## Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code has been used to create the project as a pseudo-IDE, allowing for the use of emmet commands to help create the code in an efficient manner, as well as CoPilot integration
## CoPilot
CoPilot has been used as the AI tool in this project, utilising it for both helping with code creation such as pulling bootstrap templates into the code rather than using a search engine and the documentation where possible. It has also been used to help troubleshoot any errors within the code, and helping with getting the layout of the project correct in places where I may have struggled without it
## bash terminal
Bash Terminal used for adding and commiting files to the git repository, providing versioning as well as pushing these files to GitHub as a centralised location and deployment

# Deployment
1) Add the required files to the git repository with the command
> git add .
2) Commit the changes to the repository with the command commit command
> git commit -m "Final project commit"
3) Open up the repository and go to the settings > pages menu (INSERT URL HERE)
4) Select the root directory and main branch to deploy the project (INSERT IMAGE HERE)
5) Verify that the project has been deployed by going to the main repository page and checking the deployment status on the right hand side (INSERT IMAGE AND URL HERE)
